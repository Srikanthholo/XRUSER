# Login Screen

Oculus Quest 2 Allows Learners see the powerful and engaging 3D visuals. Our brains process images faster than text, and pictures help us better comprehend information.

When individuals arrive at the XR GURU app and already have an account, it is obvious where they should go to log in. Users may sign in right from their home screen.

When individuals try to log in, they frequently mistype their password. Because the VR gadget has private vision, the app by default allows users to see the password they have typed.

If users forget their password, they can easily access the forget password screen by pressing the forget password button.
